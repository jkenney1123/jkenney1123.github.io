### Work Experience
**Teaching Assistant @ The University of Texas at Dallas (_August 2022 - January 2024_)**
- As a Teaching Assistant for Integral Calculus, my responsibilities included teaching two Problem Sections per week to a class of approximately 25 students each. Additionally, I conducted an extra grading class each semester, held regular Office Hours, and assisted with Grading. 
- 20 hours per week

### Projects
***([Bayesian Change Point Analysis of Real GDP Growth](https://github.com/jkenney1123/jkenney1123.github.io/blob/cbe567d125afff55ca4e00d334f583d6b3c328ed/Projects/Bayesian_Change_Point_Analysis.pdf))***
-	Researched the methods of Time Varying Parameter (TVP) models and Product Partition Models on Real GDP growth of eight countries to study when changes occurred in growth compared to known changes in the GDP in each country.
-	Skills Used: R, R Markdown, bcp, ggplot2, TVP, Time Series, Bayesian, Change Point, NIPS Style Report

***HuberReg: Huber and Huber Lasso Regression via Coordinate Descent***
- Created an R package that implements coordinate descent in Rcpp to perform Huber Regression and Huber Regression using an L1 penalty term with a cross validation utility to find the optimal penalty value.
- Skills Used: R, Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, Coordinate Descent, Huber Loss (Robust Regression), R Journal Style Report

***Forecasting Crimes in Dallas using actual DPD Data***
—  Capstone Project  —  Fall 2021
- Created a model to forecast reported crimes a week in advance with a team of 4 members to provide guidance for the Dallas Police Department to better allocate resources for crime prevention.
- Skills Used: R, R Markdown, Sparse VAR, VAR, AR (1), Time Series, ggplot2

***Image Classification using CNN***
—  Comp Methods for Data Scientists  —  Fall 2021
- Classified chest x-ray images as either Normal or containing Pneumonia using a convolution neural network (CNN) with a 90.2% accuracy of correct classification. This model could be used as a supplemental tool for doctors to correctly identify x-rays that may need closer inspection to determine the patients’ health status.
- Skills Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, CNN, transfer learning/fine tuning
